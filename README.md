**User Management**: users can be created and deleted, every
user has a unique nickname so a new name generates a new
user account automatically, besides, each user has a its
own password which it can be logged, (its password is
completely visible due to the simple localStorage implementation,
security is not the goal in this project).

the more food and speed you get with the snake, the more score
you can sum.
